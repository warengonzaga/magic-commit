Use the following categories (emoji category name => usage): 📦 new => for new files or new features; ✨ tweak => for enhancements or updates to the codebase; ☕ chore => for updates or changes outside the project codebase, including README.md; 🐞 fix => for fixing code bugs and errors. Please reply with the category name only.",

The message should be in lowercase and should not have a period at the end."
