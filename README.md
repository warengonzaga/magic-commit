You can do `magicc`, you can build anything that you desire. 🪄🔮💻

**Magic Commit** is a simple and easy-to-use tool that helps you to automatically stage your changes by file and commit them one by one. All you need to do is type `magicc` and accept if you love the suggested commit message in every changed files. It uses `gpt-4o-mini` as the default model from OpenAI to generate commit messages. 🪄

## 😎 Demo

[![demo](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/warengonzaga/magic-commit/main/.github/assets/demo.gif)](https://github.com/warengonzaga/magic-commit)

## 🕹️ Usage

Save all of your changes and after that run the following command:

```bash
magicc
```

This will automatically stage your changes by file and commit them one by one. All you need to do is type `magicc` and accept if you love the suggested commit message in every changed files. 🪄

> [!NOTE]  
> To be able to make it work it requires API key from [OpenAI](https://openai.com) to use the GPT-3 model. You can get your API key by signing up to their website. Once you have the API key, you can set it up by running the following command:
>
> ```bash
> magicc -s=<api-key>
> ```
>
> This will save your API key to the configuration file and you can now use the `magicc` command. I'm considering to find a provider that offers free API key for this project. 🙏 _(if you are reading this [contact me](mailto:opensource@warengonzaga.com).)_

## 📦 Installation

## 💖 Motivation

I created this project because I wanted a simple and easy-to-use tool that follows my own git commit standard by default. Additionally, I wanted to learn how to build AI-based developer tools. The goal of this project is to provide a user-friendly experience for everyone. If you're looking for more advanced features, I recommend checking out the other projects mentioned below. 🙏

This project is inspired by the following projects:

- [aicommits](https://github.com/Nutlope/aicommits) - A CLI that writes your git commit messages for you with AI.
- [ai-commit](https://github.com/insulineru/ai-commit) - Make commits easier with ChatGPT, Gitmoji and Conventional Commits.
- [opencommit](https://github.com/di-sukharev/opencommit) - About
  Auto-generate impressive commits with AI in 1 second.
- [tgpt](https://github.com/aandrew-me/tgpt) - AI Chatbots in terminal without needing API keys.
